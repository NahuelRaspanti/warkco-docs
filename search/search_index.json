This will allow you to fetch your workspace on any other device.</li> </ul> <p>To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.</p> <ul> <li>The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub. <p>Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the Synchronize sub-menu.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#open-a-file","title":"Open a file","text":"<p>You can open a file from Google Drive, Dropbox or GitHub by opening the Synchronize sub-menu and clicking Open from.
